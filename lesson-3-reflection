When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When we want to cooperate with other people on a project or when we work at different locations
  and need a remote repository to keep the commits up to date

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might want to save meaningful changes on a remote branch of our choice. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork is an operation to clone a repository on GitHub to our own GitHub account.
	clone is to copy a repository on GitHub to our local machine.
	branches refers to a set of commits that we want to seperate from the main commits of the project.
	We use fork when we need to copy a repository to our GitHub account. We use clone to save a repository to work on our computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	we could have latest verions of all files from the remote.
